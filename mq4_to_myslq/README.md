# MySQL-005.mq4

**Version:** 1.00  
**Platform:** MetaTrader 4 (MT4)

## Description

This project integrates MySQL with MetaTrader 4 (MT4) using MQL4 to manage market data and heartbeat monitoring. It stores symbol information, ask, bid prices, and timestamps in a MySQL database for tracking trading events in real-time.

### Features

- **Heartbeat Monitoring:** The system stores heartbeat data in the `Heartbeats` table to ensure continuous server connection.
- **Market Data Insertion:** The Expert Advisor (EA) logs market data (ask, bid, and symbol information) into the `MarketBDSwiss` table.
- **Database Reconnection Logic:** Implements automatic reconnection to the database in case of connection failure.

### Dependencies

- **MQLMySQL.mqh**: A custom MQL4 library to handle MySQL operations.
- **MySQL**: A database server to store and retrieve trading data.

### Tables

The following tables are used in the database:

1. **Heartbeats**: Stores the timestamp of heartbeats.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE MarketInfo.Heartbeats (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       timestamp BIGINT
   );
   ```

2. **MarketBDSwiss**: Stores market data including timestamps, ask, and bid prices for different symbols.

### Setup

1. **Database Configuration**: Create the tables `Heartbeats` and `MarketBDSwiss` in your MySQL server.
   
2. **Configure the INI file**:
   - Create a configuration file named `MyConnection.ini` under the `MQL4\Scripts` folder with the following format:
     ```
     [MYSQL]
     Host=localhost
     User=your_username
     Password=your_password
     Database=MarketInfo
     Port=3306
     Socket=
     ClientFlag=0
     ```

3. **Install the Expert Advisor**: Place the `.mq4` file in the `MQL4\Experts` folder of your MetaTrader 4 terminal and compile it.

### Usage

1. Attach the EA to any chart in MetaTrader 4.
2. The EA will automatically connect to the MySQL database and insert market data and heartbeat timestamps at regular intervals.
3. It will handle disconnection and attempt to reconnect automatically.

### Notes

- Ensure that MySQL is running and that the credentials in `MyConnection.ini` are correct.
- Adjust the reconnection logic and time intervals as needed in the `OnTimer()` function.
